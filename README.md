# Binary Trees

## Description

This project is part of the Low-Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on the implementation and understanding of **binary trees**, one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science.

By completing this project, we learn how to build, traverse, and manipulate binary trees, understand their different forms (e.g., complete, full, perfect), and analyze their time complexities compared to other data structures like linked lists.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

### General

- What is a **binary tree**
- The difference between a **binary tree** and a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- Time complexity advantages of trees over linked lists
- Definitions of **depth**, **height**, and **size** in binary trees
- Tree traversal techniques:
  - In-order
  - Pre-order
  - Post-order
  - Level-order (Breadth-First Search)
- Definitions and properties of:
  - Complete binary trees
  - Full binary trees
  - Perfect binary trees
  - Balanced binary trees
